# Power BI Business Insights – ATLIQ Hardware

## 📌 Project Overview :

This Power BI project was designed to analyze ATLIQ Hardware’s sales, financial performance, marketing trends, and supply chain operations. The goal was to transform raw data from MySQL and Excel into interactive dashboards that provide actionable insights for different business teams.

### 📊 Data Processing & Modeling :

• Data Sources: Extracted sales, forecast, and customer data from MySQL and Excel files containing operational expenses and market insights.
• Data Cleaning & Transformation : Used Power Query to remove duplicates, merge datasets, and create calculated columns (e.g., Fiscal Year, Gross Margin %).
• Data Modeling: Implemented a Star Schema connecting fact tables (Sales, Forecasts, Actual Estimates) with dimension tables (Customers, Products, Markets, Dates).
